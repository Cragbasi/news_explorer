# News Explorer App

## Project Overview

NewsExplorer is a responsive, full-stack web application that allows users to search for news articles by keyword, save articles to their personal account, and manage saved content. It features dynamic rendering, keyword tracking, user authentication, and a polished UI optimized for both desktop and mobile experiences.

The app is designed to simulate real-world news aggregation and personalization, with a focus on clean architecture, reusable components, and robust state management.

## Technologies and Implementation

- **Frontend:** React (with hooks), JSX, CSS (BEM methodology)
- **State Management:** React `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`
- **Routing:** React Router DOM
- **API Integration:** Custom `NewsApi` fetch logic with dynamic query parameters
- **Authentication:** Token-based login with `localStorage` persistence
- **UX Enhancements:** Preloader animation, error handling, conditional rendering, and keyword-based summaries

## Core Dependencies

- `react`
- `react-dom`
- `react-router-dom`
- `vite` (or `webpack`, depending on setup)
- `classnames` (optional for cleaner conditional styling)
- Custom modules:
